# Musicc_store_analysis_SQL

The Music Store Analysis SQL is a set of SQL queries designed to analyze sales, customer behavior, and trends in a music store's database. The goal is to extract insights from the data, such as identifying top-selling artists, popular genres, and customer spending patterns.

**The SQL queries typically work with multiple tables such as:** 

**Customer:** Contains customer details (ID, name, email, country).<br>
**Invoice:** Holds data about transactions (invoice ID, customer ID, total amount).<br>
**Invoice Line:** Tracks the individual items purchased (track, quantity, unit price).<br>
**Track:** Contains track details (track ID, name, genre ID).<br>
**Album:** Information on albums (album ID, name, artist ID).<br>
**Artist:** Information on artists (artist ID, name).<br>
**Genre:** The genre of the music tracks (genre ID, genre name).<br>
