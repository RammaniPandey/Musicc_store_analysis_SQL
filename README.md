# Musicc_store_analysis_SQL

The Music Store Analysis SQL is a set of SQL queries designed to analyze sales, customer behavior, and trends in a music store's database. The goal is to extract insights from the data, such as identifying top-selling artists, popular genres, and customer spending patterns.

**The SQL queries typically work with multiple tables such as:** 

* Customer: Contains customer details (ID, name, email, country).
* Invoice: Holds data about transactions (invoice ID, customer ID, total amount).
* Invoice Line: Tracks the individual items purchased (track, quantity, unit price).
* Track: Contains track details (track ID, name, genre ID).
* Album: Information on albums (album ID, name, artist ID).
* Artist: Information on artists (artist ID, name).
* Genre: The genre of the music tracks (genre ID, genre name).
